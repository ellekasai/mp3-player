## Browser Support

Following [this article](https://www.sitepoint.com/browsers-website-support/), I chose following browsers:

- Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge
- Windows IE11
- iOS 10+
- Android 5.0+

## Frameworks

- I use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for JavaScripts and got some inspiration from [this article](https://www.eduonix.com/blog/web-programming-tutorials/learn-build-audio-player-using-html5/).
- For styling HTML/CSS, I used my framework which I build from scratch.

## Music & Photos
